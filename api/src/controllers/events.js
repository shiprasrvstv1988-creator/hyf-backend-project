/**
 * Event controller (MVC example)
 *
 * This controller intentionally demonstrates how route handlers are grouped
 * for a single domain entity inside an MVC-style backend structure.
 *
 * The trainee is not expected to already be familiar with MVC as a pattern,
 * but they are expected to continue working within the structure established
 * by this skeleton.
 *
 * For that reason, this file serves two purposes:
 * 1. provide a working example of a controller handler used in the project
 * 2. show the expected controller shape as the API grows
 *
 * Important:
 * - Not every exported handler in this file is part of the required trainee scope
 * - Some handlers are placeholders included only to demonstrate controller structure
 * - Optional placeholders should only be implemented if optional/additional
 *   project scope is explicitly taken on

 * GET /api/events

 * Working required example of a controller-layer "list" handler.
 *
 * Query Parameters:
 * - page (number, optional, default = 0)
 *
 * Pagination Strategy:
 * - Fixed page size (PAGE_SIZE)
 * - offset = page * PAGE_SIZE
 * - totalItems calculated via countEvents()
 * - totalPages = ceil(totalItems / PAGE_SIZE)
 *
 * Response Shape:
 * {
 *   data: Array<Event>,
 *   meta: {
 *     page: number,
 *     pageSize: number,
 *     totalItems: number,
 *     totalPages: number
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Filtering can be added later by mapping req.query -> filters object
 * - Sorting validation should be handled before passing orderBy
